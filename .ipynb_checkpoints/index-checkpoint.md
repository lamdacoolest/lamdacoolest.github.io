# Portfolio

## 📈 Stock Return Survival Analysis

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Stock survival.jpeg" alt="Stock Survival Analysis" width="70%">
</p>

This analysis uses the **Cox Proportional Hazards** model to evaluate financial signals. Hazard ratios (**exp(coef)**) indicate how each signal affects the risk of stock delisting:

- **Hazard ratio > 1** → Higher risk of being delisted (shorter survival)
- **Hazard ratio < 1** → Lower risk (positive survival)

> Example: **Total Accruals**  
> A ratio > 1 means higher accruals increase the chance of delisting or financial distress.

Significance is determined at **p < 0.1**.
